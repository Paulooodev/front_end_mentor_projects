## Overview

### The challenge

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.


Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

I learned how to make use of different libraries most especially bootstrap for my CSS developments. Still have a long way to go understanding the concepts of media queries.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](Kevin Powell's YouTube) - This helped me alot in my CSS development of the WebPage.

- [Resource 2](Web Dev Simplified's YouTube) - This is an amazing youTube channel which helped me finally understand some basics of Javascript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning.

- [Resource 3](https://bootstrapmade.com/) - This is an amazing free website design hub that helped me a lot understand how to apply bootstrap properly. Highly recommend it to anyone trying to get learning.
